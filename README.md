# MORDRED
Here, we provide the model documentation for MORDRED (Model Of Resource Distribution and Resilient Economic Development), as well as a list of model versions, a list of the economic sectors contained in the model, and graphical representations of different parts of the model. 
MORDRED 1.0 has a CC BY-SA-NC 4.0 licence. Be aware that two excel files have to be downloaded as well in order to conduct simulations with MORDRED: model_parameters.xlsx contains structural variables. scenario_parameters.xlsx contain scenario assumptions that have to be adapted to the specific scenario study that is conducted. Feel free to integrate (parts of) MORDRED into other models, provided that they are also published under a CC BY-SA-NC license. If you only want to integrate the climate module of MORDRED, we would recommend you to download the IAM WILIAM instead since the climate module in MORDRED is a simplified version of the climate module contained in WILIAM.
Please also be aware that MORDRED was not constructed to produce accurate projections of changes in technical variables but to explore the dynamics resulting from simultanously interacting macrosystems.
For more information on simulations, please contact one of the authors that appear in the model documentation.
