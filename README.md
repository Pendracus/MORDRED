# MORDRED
Here, we provide the model documentation for MORDRED (Model Of Resource Distribution and Resilient Economic Development), as well as a list of model versions, a list of the economic sectors contained in the model, and graphical representations of different parts of the model. 
MORDRED 1.0 has a CC BY-SA-NC 4.0 licence. Be aware that two excel files have to be downloaded as well in order to conduct simulations with MORDRED: model_parameters.xlsx contains structural variables. scenario_parameters.xlsx contain scenario assumptions that have to be adapted to the specific scenario study that is conducted. 
For more information on simulation, please contact one of the authors that appear in the model documentation.
