## Overview MORDRED Versions
* Version 1.0: Basic version for which an extensive documentation is provided.
* Version 1.0.1: Difference to Version 1.0: An additional 'growth slowdown factor' was added whose effect is a reduction of the growth in consumption demand of households once the sum of direct climate damages on labor productivity and and indirect damages through the output loss factor in the food sector (sector no. 1) exceeds 0.6. The growth rate of consumption demands reaches zero once the sum of the two damage factors reach 0.9. This factor avoids a sudden collapse of the simulation in the moment where the food sector becomes unsustainable due to escalating climate damages on labor productivity. 
* Version 1.0.2: Difference to Version 1.0.1:
  1. A regulation factor was added that imposes a limit on the rate at which demand for more land generated from an expanding economy can grow. This implies a limit on the rate at which 'natural' land not used by the human economy can be integrated into the economy, i.e. by converting forests into cropland. 
  2. Input requirements for different energy types, represented by the sectors 3, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, were endogenized for sector numbers 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 through an Energy Intensity Multiplier (EIM) that depends on output per capita.
  3. The input requirement function for the energy sector that increases as a function of available fossil resources was changed from exponential to linear.
* Version 1.0.3: Difference to Version 1.0:
  1. A regulation factor was added that imposes a limit on the rate at which demand for more land generated from an expanding economy can grow (see Version 1.0.2.1.)
  2. The model was extended to allow the exogenization of fertility rates.
  3. An IPAT multiplier was added that xx
* Version 1.2: inequality factors
