## Overview MORDRED Versions
* Version 1.0
* Version 1.0.1: Difference to Version 1.0: An additional 'growth slowdown factor' was added whose effect is a reduction of the growth in consumption demand of households once the sum of direct climate damages on labor productivity and and indirect damages through the output loss factor in the food sector (sector no. 1) exceeds 0.6. The growth rate of consumption demands reaches zero once the sum of the two damage factors reach 0.9. This factor avoids a sudden collapse of the simulation in the moment where the food sector becomes unsustainable due to escalating climate damages on labor productivity. 
* Version 1.0.2: Difference to Version 1.0.1: An SSP variation factor was added. 
* Version 1.1:
